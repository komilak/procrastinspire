2.1: Ream - public habit accountability with friends
- Mobile: Phones are always on hand so whenever you want to add a new habit, check on your friends' statuses, or check off your own habit, it's on hand.
- Story: Social habit tracking - have fun with your friends keeping each other accountable.
- Market: For people on the grindset that want to self improve but have fun with their like-minded friends.
- Habit: Each time you get reamed by a friend, you're reminded of your own habit, as well as incentivized to "Get them back" with a reminder back.
- Scope: I would have to set up networking as well as account creation, in addition to a habit tracking framework.

2.2: Productive procrastination image scroller
- Mobile: Phones are most people's instinctive procrastination tool, as it's the easiest way to get the next hit of dopamine.
- Story: Allows you the buffer time of procrastination, with the good intentions of self affirmation to inspire your productivity.
- Market: Anyone with procrastination issues that want to self improve.
- Habit: Using the idea of an atomic habit, we use existing triggers and habit routines to create a more positive outcome.
