## Overview

### Description

Allows you the buffer time of procrastination, with the good intentions of self affirmation and infinite scroll content to inspire your productivity.

### App Evaluation

[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:**
- **Mobile:**Phones are most people's instinctive procrastination tool, as it's the easiest way to get the next hit of dopamine.
- **Story:**Allows you the buffer time of procrastination, with the good intentions of self affirmation to inspire your productivity.
- **Market:**Anyone with procrastination issues that want to self improve.
- **Habit:**Using the idea of an atomic habit, we use existing triggers and habit routines to create a more positive outcome.
- **Scope:**I will use an API for the image calling so most of the work would be creating good UI/UX and infrastructure for the content.
